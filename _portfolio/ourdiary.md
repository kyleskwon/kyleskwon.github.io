## Context

"Babe, do you remember what we did for our anniversary five years ago?" 

"Of course I do!" 

(Enter mild panic mode)

{:.center} 
## Problem

Most of us don't have picture perfect memory. 

Admittingly, for some partners, remembering every birthday, holiday, and all events can be difficult.

{:.center} 
## Solution

Store memories and future plans in a private setting. 

After all, every event with your partner is worth remembering.
