<h2>How did I get started as a developer?</h2>

I'm often faced with this question, and these are the 3 resources that allowed me to dive into coding.

<h3>Udemy</h3>
[“The Complete Web Developer Course” by Rob Percival](https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/) 
<p>A video lecture series that served as my first exposure to the world of web develoment. I was introduced to HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MYSQL, Bootstrap, Wordpress, and APIs.</p>

> My first website was about my brother's dog, Blu, and it looked like an ad straight out of Craigslist. But it sure was awesome.

<h3>Codecademy courses</h3>

Language Skills  | Web Developer Skills
---------------- | --------------------
HTML             | The command line
CSS              | How to make an interactive website
Ruby             | Ruby on Rails
Javascript       | Angular.JS
jQuery           | 

<h3>Bloc</h3>
<p>My remote mentorship with Bloc motivated me to teach myself. It also kept me accountable for my learning and I truly enjoyed the project-based curriculum. I enjoyed working one on one with two mentors with different approaches. Chris and Jeff helped with avoid the pitfalls that I might have experienced completely on my own and often times, pushed in the right direction.</p>
> <p>Learned how to use the command line, Git, and GitHub</p> 
> <p>Learned the fundamentals of Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM scripting, jQuery and Angular.js</p>
> <p>Built applications (using Ruby gems/APIs, create user stories/wireframes)</p>
