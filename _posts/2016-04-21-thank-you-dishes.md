title: Thank You Dishes
---

<h2>Why am I thankful to do the dishes?</h2>

<p>Call me crazy, but I love doing the dishes. First of all, I have a partnership with my girlfriend. She cooks, I clean. I find it easier to scrub away after an exquisite meal, rather than prepare and cook it. But I still try to prep and cook with her. It's not easy thinking of what to eat everyday either!</p>
<p>Second, dishes are my quiet time to myself. Just me and the plastic and silverware. I truly find it peaceful to wash away the grime and food bits, kind of like meditation. When it's all said and done, the dishes are spotless and I feel a sense of accomplishment. I know, it's silly, but I heard that people make their bed when they wake up for similar reasons. The simple things matter.</p>
<p>Lastly, I do wash those puppies knowing that who I care about doesn't have to do it later. Whether I'm a guest at a friend or family member's place, it's a small gesture that can make them feel appreciated. My mom hand washed our dishes the first 18 years of my life. And now, when she's home after work, she's tired and I can tell. The least I can do is take this task off of her hands.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Does this change the way you see the kitchen sink? It's my sanctuary I tell you!</p>
