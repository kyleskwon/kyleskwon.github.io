### Why am I addicted to photography?

<p>I'll come back to this topic in more detail later, but my top 5 reasons why I will be a photographer for life...</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Ambition</strong>
        <p>Often times, I treat photography like a sport. And when it comes to sports, I strive for greatness. But mainly, it's largely my motivation to get outside.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Storage</strong>
        <p>Unfortunately, I have selective memory, and it's hard to remember everything that I see, do and feel. Luckily, a picture can help me remember these moments in my life. Don't get me wrong, I try not to have the camera out all the time, but I love looking back and reliving the past. Memories with family and friends make this life all the worthwhile.</p>
        <p>It's also the reason why I created OurDiary. I felt that a private diary between partners was what I could use so I would keep better track of significant life events. Oh yeah, it's not as public as Facebook or other forms of social media, and I like it because sometimes, I would prefer to keep memories private.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Expression</strong>
        <p>What I decide to include in a frame is up to my thinking process in that moment. Where should I place my subject? How can I balance the foreground and the background? What colors should I bring out? Adobe Lightroom is my key to success when it comes to editing. I enjoy the workflow and it's ease of use.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Compassion</strong>
        <p>In this day and age, nearly everybody is a photographer. To me, that's awesome. I have a way to connect with people and if I can teach them a simple trick or two, it can make that person's day! It's a special feeling to take a photograph and think "Damn, I'm good."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Constant Learning</strong>
        <p>With endless amount of gadgets on the market, there are always new functions, techniques and angles to learn in photography. Each skill adds up over time and adds to my craft.</p>
