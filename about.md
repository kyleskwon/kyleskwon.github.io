<h2>Web Development</h2>

<p>From the beginning of January 2015, my main focus was to teach myself full stack web development. With the help of my mentors, I learned how to build apps with various technologies including Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Currently, I am working on my craft with frontend technologies such as Javascript, Angular.JS and jQuery.</p>

<h2>Photography, Video & Post Production</h2>

<p>Ever since I picked up my first DSLR in 2013, I fell in love with the sound of the shutter. Simply put, photography and video have made me continue to go outside. When I'm back behind my screen, editing is my playground to be creative both visually and through story telling.</p>

<h2>Globe Trotter</h2>

<p>I have been to 20 countries outside of the United States. I didn't visit a majority of those places until 2011. The amount of problem solving and self awareness that I gained can be attributed to my travels. I will forever be fascinated by the places I've seen and the people that I've encountered.</p>
