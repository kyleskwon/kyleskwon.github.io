<h2 class="heading">Web Development</h2>

{:.center-about}
<p>Since January of 2015, my main focus was to teach myself full stack web development. With the help of my mentors, I learned how to build applications with various technologies such Ruby, Rails, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. Currently, I am working on my craft with frontend technologies such as Javascript, Angular.JS and jQuery.</p>

<h3 class="heading">Global Perspective</h3>

{:.center-about}
<p>I have been to 20 countries outside of the U.S. I come from humble beginnings, and never imagined that I would be able to travel as much as I have. I gained tons of self awareness along my journey as well as problem solving skills that make life at home a breeze. You can say I was bit by the travel bug as I am fascinated by the places in our world and the people who I encountered along the way.</p>

<p>Ever since I picked up my first DSLR in 2013, I fell in love with the sound of the shutter. <a href="http://stillandmotion.herokuapp.com">Photography</a> and video motivate me to get outside. In post, editing to music is my favorite creative outlet. </p>
